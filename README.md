# webpacktut

This project was made following Gary Simon' tutorial:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzdEpgONurw&ab_channel=DesignCourse

After that it, became my webpack playground where I was able to learn how to:

- Clean the dist folder on build.
- Add a css autoprefixer.
- Separate webpack configurations for dev and prod.
- Add the .scss files to the entries to be compiled as part of the chunks.
- Output the bundled .js and .css files into an '/assets/' folder.
- Output the images into '/assets/img/' folder.
- Generating multiple HTML pages.
- Generating multiple pages in the form of 'page-name/index.html'.
- Setting a relative path for the assets so the 'page-name/index.html' pages can properly use the assets.
